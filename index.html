                        I have always had a passion for IT. At school computing was always my favourite class. 
                        Achieving top year student in IT for my last 2 years in college. I considered IT to be 
                        my hobby but after studying IT and now 2 months away from completing my degree I realised
                        my hobby can also be my career and to be honest what better career could you have.
                        I would take ownership of any position I hold, and I know I will be an asset to any 
                        employer who will be guaranteed my total commitment and focus. I am a very hard worker 
                        and consider myself to be very reliable, trustworthy and keen to learn about any 
                        industry I am in and to improve my skills. During my years of study, I have learnt
                        HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, PHP and JavaScript. I have been learning more about JavaScript
                        in my last year and learning about XML, jQuery and Ajax.

                        This is very important to me, as I like to offer customers the best customer 
                        service to ensure they get the best experience and to create long term customer
                         relationships. I know the key to any successful business is superior 
                        and excellent customer service. I am able to work under pressure and 
                        getting tasks set to me completed on time while exceeding the customers 
                        expectations.

                         I always take it upon myself to get my work done while also getting it 
                         completed to a high standard. I am always planning ahead to keep everything 
                         on track and while using my open mind and thinking outside the box 
                         I am often able to offer other options than the original task.

                          when others need assistance or under pressure and need help. Leading by 
                          example, giving support and open communication builds a high performing team. 
                          I know my commitment will be valued by your company as you would soon know 
                          that you can always rely on me to give 120%.

                         For the last 2 years I have also been nominated by my class mates to be 
                         student rep where I was the voice of the students for the IT department. 
                         This required me meet with tutors to ensure the programs were running smoothly.
